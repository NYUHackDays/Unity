Unity
=====

We'll be making a basic game in Unity.

1. What we're starting with is a basic animation for our player. We also have an idle animation ready that we'll be able to use and link later on.
2. All this has are sprites: sprite is a two-dimensional image or animation (2D computer graphics) that is integrated into a larger scene. In this project we have a collection of sprites that we will use to build our game.
3. Rename to player-sprite to Player
4. There is a clear structure to the folders. There is an Assets Folder with Animations, Artwork, Scenes, and Scripts
5. We have to make the animations to allow the player to fly, move, and just interact with his surroundings.
6. We also have to build those surroundings.
7. There are two ways to animate any particular thing.
8. We go into the folder Artwork -> sprite-sheets, and here is a collection of sprite images.
9. We select the player-sprites in the folder.
10. The slider at the bottom controls how much we are able to see of the image, so slide it to the right!
11. Sprites-sheet is just a sequence of sprite images that help us create an animation. They are images that allow you to animate things like movement.
12. Select sprites starting at player-sprite_5, hold shift, and click sprite player-sprite_14.
13. Call it PlayerWaitAnimation and save it inside Assets/Animations folder and *NOT* inside the folder it saves in defaultly.
14. Select sprites starting at player-sprite_15, hold shift and click sprite player-sprite_22. 
15. Call it PlayerMoveAnimation and save it inside Assets/Animations folder and *NOT* inside the folder it saves in defaultly.
14. Click play, and you should see it animate. You have successfully created two animations!!
15. We don't need them in the game because they are different players, but how the player reacts in the game.
16. So we can remove them. Right click them on the left window and click delete!
17. Now if you look in the Animation folder you should see both of your Animations there.
